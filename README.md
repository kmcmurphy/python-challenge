# Python Challenge
The purpose of these two challenges was to show how to import and analyze data in Python and write the results to a text file.

## PyBank
In this example, monthly profit and loss were recorded over multiple months and years. The script imports ~90 months worth of data, calculates the difference in profit month over month, finds the minimum and maximum profit and the average. Once completed, it creates an output paragraph written to a text file.

## PyPoll
In this example, ~370,000 lines of data are read in representing the results of an election. The script loops through the data, creates a list of the unique candidate names, tabulates their votes and the overall percentage they received and the winner. The output is then formatted and written to a text file.
